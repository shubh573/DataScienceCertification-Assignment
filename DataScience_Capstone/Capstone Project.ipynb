    "Road Accident is the most undesirable and unexpected thing to occur to a road user, though they happen quite often. Unfortunately, we can see a minatory rise of road accidents in United Kingdom, conspicuously highroad accidents over the past few years. It has a massive impact on society as well as in the economy of our country as there is an immense cost of fatalities and injuries. According to a recent report, annually on an average 9,000 lives have been taken by road accidents and lead to almost 28,000 injuries. This record indicates that every day, approximately 28 people were killed by road accidents and it is quite devastating. Besides this, according to WHO, the economic cost of road accidents to a developing country like us is 2-3% of GDP, which is a significant loss for a country like ours. Moreover, reducing this loss has become a great matter of concern for our country now."
